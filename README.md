# PRNG-Using-Verilog
This project implements a simple and efficient Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) using Verilog HDL, designed as part of my internship at the University of Hyderabad. The architecture is based on modular arithmetic over a 16-bit counter and generates a sequence of (x, y) output pairs, each 8 bits wide.
